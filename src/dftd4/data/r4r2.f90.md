# r4r2.f90

## Overview

The `dftd4_data_r4r2` module is a specialized data provider within the dftd4 library. It supplies pre-calculated atomic values related to the ratio of expectation values `<r⁴>/<r²>` for free atoms. This ratio is a key component in the calculation of dynamic polarizabilities and, consequently, the C6 and C8 dispersion coefficients in the DFT-D4 model. The module stores an array of these values and provides functions to access them.

Specifically, the main accessor function `get_r4r2_val_num` returns `sqrt(0.5 * (<r⁴>/<r²>) * Z )`, where Z is the atomic number. This transformed value is likely used directly in the formulas for dispersion coefficients.

## Key Components

*   **`get_r4r2_val` (interface):**
    *   This public interface allows retrieval of the processed `<r⁴>/<r²>` related values. It maps to two specific elemental functions:
        *   **`get_r4r2_val_num(atomic_number)`:** (Elemental Function) Returns `sqrt(0.5 * (<r⁴>/<r²>) * Z )` for a given atomic number `Z`.
        *   **`get_r4r2_val_sym(element_symbol)`:** (Elemental Function) Returns the same processed value for a given element chemical symbol. It internally converts the symbol to an atomic number.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`max_elem` (parameter):** An integer parameter defining the maximum atomic number for which data is stored, set to `118` (Oganesson).
*   **`r4_over_r2(max_elem)` (real(wp), parameter):**
    *   A private array storing the raw `<r⁴>/<r²>` expectation values for elements up to Oganesson.
    *   The comments indicate these values were primarily calculated by S. Grimme (PBE0/def2-QZVP, Gaussian 2010), with some rare gas values recalculated by J. Mewes (PBE0/aug-cc-pVQZ, Dirac 2018), and H, Li, Be also recalculated (PBE0/cc-pVQZ). Some superheavy elements (Cn, Nh, Fl, Lv, Og) were newly added. Am-Rg were calculated at 4c-PBE/Dyall-AE4Z (Dirac 2022).
    *   These values are in Bohr atomic units (implicitly, as `<r⁴>` would be Bohr⁴ and `<r²>` would be Bohr², so the ratio is Bohr²).
*   **`sqrt_z_r4_over_r2(max_elem)` (real(wp), parameter):**
    *   A private array that stores the final values returned by `get_r4r2_val_num`.
    *   It is calculated as `sqrt(0.5 * r4_over_r2(i) * real(i, wp))` for each element `i`.

## Usage Examples

The `get_r4r2_val` function is used to retrieve the processed value for use in dispersion coefficient calculations.

```fortran
MODULE example_using_r4r2
  USE dftd4_data_r4r2
  ! Or, more commonly, through the main dftd4_data module:
  ! USE dftd4_data, ONLY : get_r4r2_val
  USE mctc_env, ONLY : wp
  IMPLICIT NONE

  SUBROUTINE show_r4r2_related_values
    REAL(wp) :: val_H_num, val_He_sym, val_Fe_num

    val_H_num = get_r4r2_val(1)    ! Get value for Hydrogen (Z=1)
    val_He_sym = get_r4r2_val("He") ! Get value for Helium by symbol
    val_Fe_num = get_r4r2_val(26)  ! Get value for Iron (Z=26)

    PRINT *, "Processed <r4>/<r2> related value for Hydrogen (Z=1): ", val_H_num
    PRINT *, "Processed <r4>/<r2> related value for Helium (Symbol He): ", val_He_sym
    PRINT *, "Processed <r4>/<r2> related value for Iron (Z=26): ", val_Fe_num

  END SUBROUTINE show_r4r2_related_values

END MODULE example_using_r4r2
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`mctc_env`:** Provides `wp` for defining working precision.
*   **`mctc_io_convert`:** Provides `aatoau` (though not directly used in the final `sqrt_z_r4_over_r2` array, it might have been used in pre-processing the raw `r4_over_r2` if they were originally in different units, but the comment implies the stored `r4_over_r2` are already processed to some extent).
*   **`mctc_io_symbols`:** Provides the `to_number` function to convert element symbols to atomic numbers.
*   **`dftd4_data` (Aggregator Module):** The `dftd4_data_r4r2` module is primarily used by `dftd4_data`, which re-exports the `get_r4r2_val` interface.
*   **Dispersion Model Modules (e.g., `dftd4_model_d4`, `dftd4_model_d4s`):** These modules are major consumers of the values provided by `get_r4r2_val`. These values are critical for calculating C6 and C8 dispersion coefficients from atomic dynamic polarizabilities and static C6 coefficients.
*   **Damping Function Modules (e.g., `dftd4_damping_rational`):** The `<r⁴>/<r²>` values (or the processed form) are used in constructing parameters (like `r0ij`) for some damping functions.
